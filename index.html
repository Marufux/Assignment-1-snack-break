                Back in 2019, The founder of <span id="mamz">Snack Break</span> name Sakib Hossain discovered a small
                burger restaurant in Dhanmondi, and wrote the first page of our history. From humble beginnings as a
                small restaurant, we're proud to have become one of the country's leading food service brand with 50
                restaurants in the whole country. Also we always care about the hygiene of our food.

                <p class="yesone">
                    The original burger starts with a 100% pure beef burger seasoned with just a pinch of salt and
                    pepper. Then, the McDonald’s burger is topped with a tangy pickle, chopped onions, ketchup and
                    mustard. McDonald’s hamburger contains no artificial flavors, preservatives or added colors from
                    artificial sources.* Our pickle contains an artificial preservative, so skip it if you like.

                <p class="yesone">
                    The pizza originally began as a family-sized pizza that was brought out to the table by an employee
                    and placed on a raised rack in the centre of the table. Later it was scaled down to a personal-sized
                    pizza. By 1991, the McDonald's test markets for pizza had grown to over 500 McDonald's locations
                    before the pizza test was placed on hold. Pizza was discontinued in most restaurants by 2000.
